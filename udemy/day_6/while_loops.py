# For Loops ex:
# for item in list_of_items:
    # do something to each item

# for number in range(a, b):
    # print(number)

# While something_is_true:
    # do something repeatedly  *note: only when something is FALSE, does the loop stop

#for Reeborg's world hurdle 2:

#while not at_goal():
    #jump()

#OR 

#while at_goal != True:
    #jump()
